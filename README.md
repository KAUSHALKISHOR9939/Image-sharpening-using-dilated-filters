# Image-sharpening-using-dilated-filters
* In response to the challenges posed by the varied
image sensors and hardware limitations in mobile devices, this
research explores the application of dilated filters, inspired by
their success in edge detection, to traditional image sharpening
techniques. The study enhances low-cost computational methods
like High Pass Filters (HPF) and Unsharp Masking (UM)
using dilated filters. The modified sharpening algorithms achieve
superior visual and statistical results compared to conventional
approaches.
## Conclusion
*Sharpening and image enhancement is an important process
in the computer vision domain.
